It may be that a lack of access to similar facilities is limiting the development of children within the area.  What is the current situation with your existing facilities? What are you being prevented from achieving as an organisation, or for your pupils, as a result of not upgrading your facilities? This is one of the most important parts of your Project Narrative. You have to be able to prove to funders that there is a genuine need for your project. If there are any agendas your project can address then include it.</p>

If you are addressing a specific agenda (for example: an ageing community) can you provide evidence that having access to your project will have a positive impact on health and wellbeing? Statistics are really powerful here. If you can link to studies which have already been done that quantify the impact of your project on health and wellbeing etc. then it will greatly improve your chances of acquiring funding.</address>

If your vision is to become a regional centre of excellence for special needs education, then you should write about why your new project will help make that happen.
